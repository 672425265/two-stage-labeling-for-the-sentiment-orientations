# two-stage-labeling-for-the-sentiment-orientations
Our algorithm is based a two-stage labeling for the sentiment orientations. A two-level network is accordingly proposed to utilize the two labeled data in the two-stage labeling strategy. Lexical cues (e.g., polar words, POS, conjunction words) are also used in our two-level network with a new encoding strategy. Please refer to our paper at arXiv for details: -hot Lexicon Embedding-based Two-level LSTM for Sentiment Analysis.
